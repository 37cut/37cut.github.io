            <p>Fuck 1 miss.

                <p>&emsp;Mouse: Logitech G102 (2 accel);

            <h1>Fast connection</h1>
            <h2>A method to boost your Internet(maybe)</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Since it's pretty slow to access osu website(me in China),
                <p>I find a way to get a fast connection.
                <p>At least I can finally access the bancho now(I've been struggling to login for a long time before).

                <br><br>

                <p>1. Visit osu faster.
                <p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest">this</a> website.
                <p>Execute a file which is called CloudflareST(or CloudflareST.exe sth else).
                <p>Wait till it gets an output.
                <p>Choose the fast ip in "result.csv".
                <p>Then change your host file.
                <p>Example: <a href="https://37cut.is-a.dev/files/etc/hosts">Click me</a>

                <br><br>

                <p>2. Download beatmap smoothly(sadly I can't use this anymore).
                <p>Now go to <a href="https://github.com/KyuubiRan/BeatmapDownloader">this</a> website.
                <p>Go to releases(on the right of website), download "Release-x86.zip".
                <p>Make a directory inside your osu folder like "Injector"
                <p>Unzip Release-x86.zip, move Downloader.dll and Injector.exe to directory you've been created.

            <h2>Maps</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>1. Enjoy maps
                <p>Except ez, low ar(&lt;~8), old,
                <p>the "classic" farms, usually I enjoy all other maps,
                <p>but I still prefer maps I like.
                <p id="tiny">why there're so many tv sizes... I dont want to be that...

                <br><br>

                <p>2. Map songs
                <p>Link for mod: https://osumod.com/
                <p>Mod steps:
                <p>1. Read the modder's preference(If fit then go on, otherwise change)
                <p>2. Upload the link which map to mod
                <p>3. Wait.
                <p>4. If he/she reject, and you really try hard to map, the map is clear(you can play),
                <p>   switch to another modder.(Maybe It's not in pending status or finish set so he/she reject)
                <p>5. Done.

                <br><br>

                <p>Overflow of a map:
                <p>|-- Picking songs(VERY IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY your favourite songs).
                <p>|-- Read rc(Ranking criteria).
                <p>|-- Listen to music and put notes.
                <p>|-- If done, play it by yourself first(I recommended PLAYABLE first).
                <p>|-- Find mistakes by YOU as MUCH as possible.
                <p>|-- If you think you can't find any problems, find modders.
                <p>&emsp;|-- ISSUE MUST FIX.
                <p>&emsp;|-- DO NOT ALWAYS follow modders ADVICE,
                <p>&emsp;|-- however, if you really get some mistakes just correct it.
                <p>&emsp;|-- But still, some little problems you are going to think why is that.
                <p>|-- Hitsound your map and put some custom hitsound in it(hitsound MUST included). 
                <p>|-- If you think the basic structure is done, put it to PENDING status.
                <p>|-- Now, you must find some BNs to mod your map,
                <p>|-- besides, try to get at least 5 hypes. 
                <p>...

                <br><br>

                <p>Once the ten requests done.
                <p>I'll show the possibility of WIP map modding acceptable rate.
                <p>Current: 3 rejects | 2 finish | 5 pending
                <p>which is 1/5 - 20% chance can pass.

                <br><br>

                <p>You know what? Map more is extremely hard for me.
                <p>Why that? Less song attracts me.
                <p>Picking songs is the most difficult part.
                <p>For me, I cant map complex rhythm, or simple rhythm, or "repeat nightmare".
                <p>If someone maps that song and ranked it, I have less chance to map that. 

                <br><br>

                <p><b>Never request a modding queue which makes you uncomfortable</b>,
                <p>such as "I mod what I like" or "long article of rules" or "a bunch of reject tags",
                <p>always find easy queue like "casual" or "for newble" or "known BNs/GMT".

            <h2>Something like "Stable vs Lazer"</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>I can't think of any advantages of Stable, or maybe skin is an virtue?
                <p>Lazer either, It's just too common. <span id="tiny">where's my skin interface?</span>
                <p>Both of them are 'incomplete' project.
