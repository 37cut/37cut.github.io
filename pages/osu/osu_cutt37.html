                <p>1. Enjoy maps
                <p>Except ez, low ar(&lt;~8), old,
                <p>the "classic" farms, usually I enjoy all other maps,
                <p>but I still prefer maps I like.
                <p id="tiny">why there're so many tv sizes... I dont want to be that...

                <br><br>

                <p>2. Map songs
                <p>Link for mod: https://osumod.com/
                <p>Mod steps:
                <p>1. <span id="im">Read the modder's preference(If fit you can upload , otherwise change)</span>.
                <p>2. Upload the link which map+diff to mod.
                <p>3. Wait.
                <p>4. If he/she reject, and you really try hard to map, the map is clear and <span id="su">you can play</span>,
                <p>   switch to another modder.(Maybe It's not in pending status or finish set so he/she reject)
                <p>5. Done.

                <br><br>

                <p>Overflow of a map:
                <p>|-- Picking songs(<span id="im">important</span>, <span id="su">not only your favourite songs</span>).
                <p>|-- <span id="su">Read rc(Ranking criteria)</span>.
                <p>|-- Listen to music and put notes.
                <p>|-- If done, play it <span id="su">by yourself</span> first(I recommended <span id="tg">playable</span> first).
                <p>|-- Find mistakes <span id="su">by you</span> as <span id="im">much</span> as possible.
                <p>|-- If you think you can't find any problems, find modders.
                <p id="tab">|-- <span id="tg">Issue</span> must fix.
                <p id="tab">|-- Do <span id="im">not</span> always follow modders <span id="tg">advice</span>,
                <p id="tab">|-- however, if you really get some mistakes then <span id="im">you should</span> correct it.
                <p id="tab">|-- But still, some little problems you are going to think <span id="su">why</span> is that.
                <p>|-- Hitsound your map and put some custom hitsound in it(hitsound <span id="im">must</span> included). 
                <p>|-- If you think the basic structure is done, put it to <span id="tg">pending</span> status.
                <p>|-- Now, you must find some BNs to mod your map,
                <p>|-- besides, try to get at least 5 hypes. 
                <p>...
                <p>And yes I really need contacts,
                <p>otherwise I'm going to put a lot of time to rank(or never rank) one map.

                <br><br>

                <p>Once the ten requests done.
                <p>I'll show the possibility of WIP map modding acceptable rate.
                <p>Current: 3 rejects | 2 finish | 5 pending
                <p>which is 1/5 - 20% chance can pass.

                <br><br>

                <p><span id="im">Never request a modding queue which makes you uncomfortable</span>,
                <p>such as "I mod what I like" or "long article of rules" or "a bunch of reject tags",
                <p>always find easy queue like "casual" or "for newble"(idk how to say, its just feelings).

            <div class="container">
                <p>I can't think of any advantages of Stable, or maybe skin is an virtue?
                <p>Lazer either, It's just too common. <span id="tiny">where's my skin interface?</span>
                <p>Both of them are 'incomplete' project.
