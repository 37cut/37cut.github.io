                <p>Virus broke my osu skill, pain broke my mind, quit for sometime.
                <p>Setup:
			    <p>&emsp;Mouse: Logitech G102 (2 accel);
			    <p>&emsp;Keyboard: Sayo O2C + Greywood v3 switch;
                <p>&emsp;Resolution: 1920x1080, 15&quot;6			
                <p>&emsp;Typing: Alternate;

            <h1>Misc.</h1>
            <h2>A method to boost your Internet(maybe)</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Since it's pretty slow to access osu website(me in China),
                <p>I find a way to get a fast connection.
                <p>At least I can finally access the bancho now(I've been struggling to login for a long time before).

                <br><br>

                <p>1. Visit osu faster.
                <p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest">this</a> website.
                <p>Execute a file which is called CloudflareST(or CloudflareST.exe sth else).
                <p>Wait till it gets an output.
                <p>Choose the fast ip in "result.csv".
                <p>Then change your host file.
                <p>Example: <a href="https://37cut.is-a.dev/files/etc/hosts">Click me</a>

                <br><br>

                <p>2. Download beatmap smoothly(sadly I can't use this anymore).
                <p>Now go to <a href="https://github.com/KyuubiRan/BeatmapDownloader">this</a> website.
                <p>Go to releases(on the right of website), download "Release-x86.zip".
                <p>Make a directory inside your osu folder like "Injector"
                <p>Unzip Release-x86.zip, move Downloader.dll and Injector.exe to directory you've been created.
            </div>

            <h2>Something like "Stable vs Lazer"</h2>        
            <div class="container">
                <p>When you get well with Stable,
                <p>you'll find that hard to read Lazer now(not sure, my personal option).
                <p>Stable got a comfort approach circle, nice view(kind soft and focus).
                <p>Lazer seems like more focus on rhythm(device and hitsounds rhythm).
                <p>But I don't need so many buttons/options under Lazer.
                <p>The problem under Lazer is high delay when in a multiplayer server.

                <p>70% players trash.
                <p>Like request modding maps, I send a request.
                <p>They don't care(70%), or refuse your request(30%), since my map fit the rules.
                <p>They are such a lazy worm don't even add "no newble mapper".
                <p>In multiplayer, I've always kicked by those little shit hosts.
                <p>If you play well, they'll also kick you.
                <p>Then why public?
                <p>Btw they're boring too(I hate farms).
                <p>They are such a selfish person. <i>*sign*</i>

            <h2>Being host</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Don't care about what players said.
                <p>Start on a proper time(30~40secs+10secs for addition ).
                <p>Since I met a situlation: shall I wait for the bad Internet players?
                <p>It's a pretty nice question.
